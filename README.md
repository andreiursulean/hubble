## Hubble - Tech Challenge

You have to solve three (3) problems. You will find detailed instructions about each problem in their specific folder.

#### How to solve

1. Fork the repo.
2. Make at least one commit for each problem. More granular and detailed commits are preferred.
3. Make sure your fork is publicly accesible. Paste the link to it in the application form.

#### Important information

In order for your application to be considered, you will need to provide a solution to this task even if it's not a complete one.

If you have any questions about the challenge, we insist that you open an issue on this repo. As a last resort, you can send us an email at upbdrive@gmail.com or contact us directly on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/upbdrive).

### Candidate's notes 
All the problems have been solved completely.

For problem 1, the *requests* library has been used to fetch the html text from the website
and *BeautifulSoup* was used in order to parse the information. The main.py is documented so
check there for more information.

Problem 2 was written in bash 4. The number of teams participating per country are added in 
an associative array and then all the *key,values* pairs from that array are written in the file.
The teams.csv file outputted from the previous exercise has been copied in the current working 
directory for convenience

Problem 3. Change *i* from for( i = 0; i < n; *i*++ ) to *n* -> for( i = 0; i < n; *n*++ )
